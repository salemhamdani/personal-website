Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _Software Software Engineer_ at [P&T Software GmbH](https://en.pt.software/) _and Machine Learning Researcher_ at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) based out of Vancouver.

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer with a passion for writing code. I'm well acquainted with *backend* & *frontend* as well as *cloud technologies*, *database*, *machine learning* and *academic research*. I have always been a firm believer in the human-centered approach to technology and understanding the end user. Whether building software systems or training machine learning models, I strive to create solutions that are not only technically sound but also practical, intuitive, and impactful. I primarily code in **Python** and **Typescript**.

In my free time, I love playing volleyball, horseback riding, cooking, reading books, and exploring neighborhoods through food.
