## Technologies Used

This project is built with the following technologies:

*   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
*   **Chakra UI**: A simple, modular and accessible component library that gives you the building blocks you need to build your React applications.
*   **Emotion**: A library designed for writing CSS styles with JavaScript.
*   **Framer Motion**: A production-ready motion library for React.
*   **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: A library to animate elements as you scroll down, and up.
*   **Sass**: A preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
*   **React Scripts**: Configuration and scripts for Create React App.

## Setup and Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/salemhamdani/personal-website.git
    cd personal-website
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment

This project uses GitHub Pages for deployment.

1.  Ensure your `package.json` has the correct `homepage` field:
    ```json
    "homepage": "https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>",
    ```

2.  Run the deployment script:
    ```sh
    npm run deploy
    ```
    This command will first run `npm run build` to build the application, and then deploy the `build` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.
